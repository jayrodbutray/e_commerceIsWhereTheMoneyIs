# e_commerceIsWhereTheMoneyIs

## This homework gave me an opportunity to refine my backend API and route writing skills to pull from Product, Category and Tag models for an e-commerce site. Seed and schema data were already in place and ready to be pulled upon when routes and API's were written. I was able to create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in order to be able to fetch all data from a model, create new data for a model, update a data entry to change something, and be able to delete objects as well. Then with all those routes, I was able to test them in Insomnia which told me if they worked or not.

### I was actually able to do most of this work myself which was surprising. My fearless instructor, Robbert, gave me an amazing tutorial of Insomnia, which allowed me to find errors and fix them to the point where data was able to be structured in the manner listed above in ##.
